# Prerequisites

## Xcode

On a new machine Xcode is required for most anything.

Open a terminal, enter the following, then go for a coffee â˜•...

```sh
xcode-select --install
```

## Homebrew

Homebrew manages all the utilities and apps we need to do the job.

Visit [https://brew.sh](https://brew.sh) to confirm install command is up to date.

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

# Install

This repo clones into the `$HOME` path for simple cross-machine consistent configuration.
For more details on the approach see: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles

Run the install script below.

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timkinnane/node-dev-dotfiles/trunk/bin/install-dotfiles)"
```

What does this script do?

1. Clones the repo to `~/.cfg` for working tree at `~/` including:
	- A ZSH config file with sensible defaults
	- `config` alias to run git commands on this repo
	- `secret` bin script for storing shell secrets in your key chain
	- `awssso` bin script for interacting with AWS SSO profiles
2. Ignores any user files that aren't explicitly tracked
3. Installs app bundle with Homebrew...
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstucdio.com/)
  - [Open VPN Connect](https://code.visualstucdio.com/)
  - [Glow markdown CLI](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow)
4. Compiles an Antibody bundle of ZSH plugins to load on shell init
5. Takes inputs for creating global git config file

Other apps can be manually installed, e.g recommended: [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/), [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/), [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/).

```
brew install alfred insomnia warp
```
